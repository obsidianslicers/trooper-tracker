    <p>
        Trooper!
    </p>
    <p>
        Congratulations. Your application has survived the scrutiny of the
        Imperial bureaucracy and your armor has been deemed
        <strong>adequately intimidating</strong>. You are now officially
        filed with the <em>{{ setting('site_name') }} Troop Tracker</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        From this moment forward, you'll be expected to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>March in formation (or at least look like you're trying).</li>
        <li>Keep a watchful eye on those wandering mercs - they're slippery when you're not looking.</li>
        <li>Pretend you don't notice that the Rebels always seem to escape.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please review the upcoming deployments. In the meantime, polish that bucket - we expect
        it to shine brighter than a Tatooine sunrise.
    </p>

        - Imperial Administration, {{ setting('site_name') }}
